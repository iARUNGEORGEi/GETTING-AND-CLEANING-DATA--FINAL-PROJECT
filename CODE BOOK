Codebook for tidy data from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone
This Code book explains the variables and summaries calculated from a data set that represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Data source
The data was obtained originally obtained from:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data used to develop the project was downloaded from:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Data processing
The original downloaded data was decompresed in a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset," which was located in the working directory.

The data was processed with the script run_analysis.R does the following:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Results
The result is a data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, which is stored in the file called "tidy_set.txt."
